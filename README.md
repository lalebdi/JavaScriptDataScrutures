Problem solving steps:

1. Understand the problem:
    Start with:
        1- Can I restate the problem in my own words? (In your own words -> To make sure you understand what the question is.)
            2- What are the inputs that go into the problem? 
                3- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
                    4- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough info to solve the problem?
