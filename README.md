Problem solving steps:

1. Understand the problem:
    Start with:
        1- Can I restate the problem in my own words? (In your own words -> To make sure you understand what the question is.)
            2- What are the inputs that go into the problem? 
                3- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
                    4- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough info to solve the problem? 
                        5- How should I label the important pieces of the data that are a part of the problem?

2. Concete Examples:
  Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem. Examples also provide sanity checks that your solution works how it should. (User Stories or Unit Tests)
      * Start with simple examples. 2 or 3 with an input and a output. Easiest use cases. 
      *     * Progress to more complex examples.
      *         * Explore examples with empty inputs. (edge cases)
      *             * Explore examples with invalid inputs.
