Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lalebdi/JavaScriptDataScrutures.git
```

Problem solving steps:

1. Understand the problem:
    Start with:
        1- Can I restate the problem in my own words? (In your own words -> To make sure you understand what the question is.)
            2- What are the inputs that go into the problem? 
                3- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
                    4- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough info to solve the problem? 
                        5- How should I label the important pieces of the data that are a part of the problem?

2. Concete Examples:
  Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem. Examples also provide sanity checks that your solution works how it should. (User Stories or Unit Tests)
      * Start with simple examples. 2 or 3 with an input and a output. Easiest use cases. 
      *      Progress to more complex examples.
      *          Explore examples with empty inputs. (edge cases)
      *              Explore examples with invalid inputs. 
  
3. Break It Down:
     AKA Pseudo-code
         Write the steps you will take.

4. Solve or Simplify:
    Simplify infers solving a simpler problem =>
        - Find the core of the difficulty in what you're trying to do.
        -      Temporarily ignore that difficulty.
        -           Write a simplified solution.
        -               Then incorporate that difficulty back in.
5. Look Back and Refactor:
    ~ Can you check the result?
        ~ Can you derive the result differently?
            ~ Can you understand it at a glance?
                ~ Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
                    ~ Can you improve the performace of your solution?
                        ~ can you think of other ways to refactor?
                            ~ How have other people solved this problem?

Patterns:
1. Frequency Counters:
    This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values. This can often avoid the need for nested for loops "O(n^2)" operations with arrays/strings. 2 loops are better than nested loops. 
        => The idea is usually use an object to construct a profile to break down the contents of an array or string and compare that break down to another on how they look. 

2. Multiple Pointers:
