//       9
//   4       20
//  1   6   15  170

// InOrder = [1, 4, 6, 9, 15, 20, 170]
// PreOrder = [9, 4, 1, 6, 20, 15, 170] -> starts from the root node and is great for recreating the tree.
// PostOrder = [1, 6, 4, 15, 170, 20 , 9] -> all the way down then to the top. the children come before the parent.
